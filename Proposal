For our final project we will be implementing the Simon game. We plan to implement a total of  four LED lights on our breadboard in order to randomize the sequences. In order to win, we plan to have the user be able to do nine button presses for the winning sequence. In our game, we are having a total of nine rounds. If the right sequence is pressed, we will display the score of the player after every round and move on to the next round, increasing the number of LED sequences by one, making it more challenging for the player. If the wrong sequence is pressed, the game ends and the LCD displays game over, and a question to play again. We will also implement a button that functions to both start the game and to start over the game if the player loses.
